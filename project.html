            <p class="information">The Leenheerenpolder is a piece of land which is located in the area of Goudswaard. This land is around 130 hectares big and is supposed to be a large tidal nature. In the past this land was used for farming, but the new owners want to use
                this land to innovate the area and give an economic impulse to the nearby village. In the past there were many ideas to give input to this land, but most of these ideas failed or their requirements were not met.<br><br> The idea of this
                project by Zeelenberg Architectuur is to make this land habitable for people. They want to build houses on steels which will prevent them from taking damage when the water rises. These houses will be built in the north-east side of the
                land so the south side is free for wildlife and tidal nature. The houses need to be +2.6m NAP. To access the house there will be elevated footpaths and a staircase which will lead to the houses. For easy access and transport there will
                be rivers which are connected to the Spui river where people could sail or ride their boat. This way people will be able to access their houses when the water level is high or low. Furthermore there will be an area for elderly people.
                This way we can make a place for the elderly, who will live on their own, where they can enjoy a place with a beautiful nature and environment for walking in peace and quiet. There will also be a retirement home where elderly people who
                are less able to take care of themselves will be cared for. This creates job opportunities without nature being seriously inconvenienced by, for example, noise pollution.
                <br><br> The tidal nature which is located at the bottom side of the land will be a non-human area. There will be a pathway around the area, but there won't be any human interference (apart from some outposts to watch birds) in this piece
                of land. The idea behind this part is to let nature take care of itself and give the land a new purpose, a home for animals. To make this place livable for animals we need to transform the current landscape. By adding some treeâ€™s, rivers
                and maybe a small lake, animals will feel like home and hopefully reproduce so there will be more wildlife in this area.<br><br> To strengthen the dyke there will be a pathway/road where people can walk/ ride around the area. To actually
                realise this plan there is a need to reinforce the current dyke. If possible there will be a dam added too so it can regulate the water and keep everything inside the area protected.</p>
