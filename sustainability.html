            <div class="information">
                <p>What is sustainability and how do we measure it? Sustainability is the capacity to endure in a relatively ongoing way across various domains of life. Sustainability has also been described as "meeting the needs of the present generation
                    without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs." (Brundtland, 1987).
                    <br> But how do we measure sustainability if this concept of “needs” isn’t measurable?
                    <br>In our project we measured sustainability by having people fill in a form and based on those results we calculated how sustainable a project is. Sustainability in our case is based on people’s opinions.
                    <br><br>Our form consists of five main parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Job Opportunities</li>
                        <li>Innovation and Infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
                        <li>Life below Water</li>
                        <li>Life on Land</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br> In our calculations we gave every question a total of 10 points. The average rating of a question was its total points. We sum all those results and divided them by the total number of answers we got the average sustainability
                    rating of people. This will be the sustainability percentage which is displayed on our website. After that there will be a grade automatically displayed underneath the percentage:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>F = Less than 25%</li>
                        <li>E = 25% - 40%</li>
                        <li>D = 40% - 55%</li>
                        <li>C = 55% - 70%</li>
                        <li>B = 70% - 85%</li>
                        <li>A = More than 85%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br> In our opinion, a project should be at least 70% sustainable if the client wants to go through with it.
                    <br>A project that has a sustainability percentage of at least 55 has potential, but will need some reworking.
                    <br> And a project with a percentage below 55, should be completely rebuild from the ground up.
